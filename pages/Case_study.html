        <p>Career transitions are never easy, especially when you’ve been working in the same field for years. But sometimes, life nudges you toward new possibilities, even when they seem out of reach. Meet Sunny, a mechanical engineer from Indore, whose inspiring story shows how passion, perseverance, and the right mentorship can open doors to extraordinary success.
          <br><br>

          From earning just ₹25,000 a month as a Design Engineer to securing an 11 LPA package as a Senior <a href= "../index.html" style="color: #e5533c;">Full-Stack Developer</a> , Sunny’s journey proves that it’s never too late to change paths. <a href= "../index.html" style="color: #e5533c;">Coding Sharks</a> was the bridge that helped him transition from mechanical engineering to the world of IT—and we’re here to tell his story. <br>

        <hr>
        <br>
        <h1>Chapter 1: Stuck in a Comfortable But Unfulfilling Job</h1>
        For five years, Sunny worked as a Design Engineer at a mechanical firm in Indore. While his job was stable, the monthly paycheck of ₹25,000 barely covered his expenses, leaving little room for savings or personal growth. What troubled him more was the lack of excitement and future opportunities in his career. <br><br>

        He had bigger dreams—he wanted a career that was both intellectually stimulating and financially rewarding. But every time Sunny thought about switching industries, the fear of the unknown held him back. <br><br>

        That’s when coding entered his life. <br>

        <hr>
        <br>
        <h1>Chapter 2: A New Spark—Discovering His Passion for Coding</h1>
        Sunny’s interest in coding began almost by accident. He started learning programming on YouTube during weekends, out of curiosity. What started as a hobby soon became a passion. He found joy in solving coding puzzles, writing small programs, and exploring how software powers modern technology. <br><br>

        But transitioning into IT seemed challenging without proper mentorship.<br>

        “Where do I start? How will I compete with computer science graduates? What if I fail?” Sunny had many questions but no answers. He realized that self-learning wasn’t enough—he needed a structured learning path and hands-on guidance to make the leap. That’s when he came across  <a href= "../index.html" style="color: #e5533c;">Coding Sharks</a>. <br>

        <hr>
        <br>  
        <h1>Chapter 3: Joining Coding Sharks —The Turning Point</h1>
        When Sunny reached out to us, we could tell that he was determined to change his life. His story was familiar: a skilled professional stuck in a job that didn’t align with his ambitions, looking for a way out. But what made him stand out was his resilience and hunger to learn. <br><br>

        At  <a href= "../index.html" style="color: #e5533c;">Coding Sharks</a>, we designed a personalized learning path for Sunny, focusing on  <a href= "../index.html" style="color: #e5533c;">full-stack development</a>. The goal was not just to teach him to code but to prepare him for the real-world challenges of the IT industry.

        <hr>
        <br>  
        <h1>Chapter 4: Learning by Doing—Practical Projects and Mentorship</h1>
        Our bootcamp wasn’t just about theory—it was about solving real problems. Sunny dived into frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and React while simultaneously learning backend frameworks like Node.js and Express. We also introduced him to databases, version control (Git), and project management tools—all essential skills for a  <a href= "../index.html" style="color: #e5533c;">full-stack developer</a>.<br><br>

        Sunny thrived in this project-based environment. He worked on: <br>
        <li>Building interactive web applications from scratch</li>
        <li>Developing backend APIs to handle user data</li>
        <li>Collaborating on live projects with real-world challenges</li>
        <br> 

       He quickly realized that coding was more than just syntax—it was about logical problem-solving and structured thinking.

        <h1>Chapter 5: Pushing Through Challenges</h1>
        Switching careers is never easy, and Sunny’s journey was no exception. There were days when he struggled with complex concepts and felt overwhelmed by the workload. But he never gave up.<br><br>

        “I used to work late into the night, revisiting concepts I couldn’t understand during the day,” Sunny recalls. His dedication was unmatched—he was willing to put in the extra hours, solve practice problems repeatedly, and seek feedback from mentors to improve.<br><br>

        With every challenge he overcame, Sunny grew more confident. Slowly but surely, he began to master  <a href= "../index.html" style="color: #e5533c;">full-stack development</a>.  

        <hr>
        <br>
        <h1>Chapter 6: From ₹25,000 a Month to 11 LPA—A Dream Fulfilled</h1>
        After months of hard work and intensive learning, Sunny was ready to step into the IT industry. The job market, however, wasn’t easy. Sunny faced multiple rejections, but he stayed focused and continued applying. His persistence paid off when he received an offer that would change his life— a Senior  <a href= "../index.html" style="color: #e5533c;">Full-Stack Developer</a> role with an 11 LPA package. <br><br>

        This was a 4x jump from his previous salary—a dream come true for Sunny, who had once felt trapped in a mechanical job with limited prospects. His story became a shining example of what’s possible with the right mindset, determination, and mentorship.

        <hr>
        <br>
        <h1>Chapter 7: Why Sunny’s Story Matters</h1>
        Sunny’s transformation from a mechanical engineer in Indore to a high-earning software developer is a testament to the power of career transitions. He showed that background doesn’t matter—whether you’re from mechanical engineering or any other field, with the right guidance, you can succeed in tech. <br><br>

        At  <a href= "../index.html" style="color: #e5533c;">Coding Sharks</a>, we are proud to have been a part of his journey. Sunny’s story proves that dreams are achievable, no matter how challenging the road may seem.
